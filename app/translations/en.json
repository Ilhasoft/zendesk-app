Our solution gives users autonomy so they can build conversation flows and easily integrate them with systems in different countries. We have our own NLP system, which is global, collaborative, and open-source. It also includes languages unexplored by the biggest players in the market.\n\nAt the core of $BRAND$ lies our powerful flow engine. With flows you can..\n\n * Manage and organize millions of contacts\n * Interact with them via SMS, chat apps and telephone calls\n * Build powerful applications without writing a line of code\n\nFlows can also open tickets through different services allowing human agents to take over communication with a contact.
